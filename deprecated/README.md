# Deprecated (Archived Experiments)

This folder contains archived experimental code/configs and run outputs that are no longer used.

Contents:
- `deprecated/extreme_model/`: Archived ST-Former prototype (code + `results/`).
- `deprecated/model/configs/wgdgtm_temporal_attn_macro.yaml`: Archived WG-DGTM temporal-attention config.

Note:
- If you need to run an archived package again, move it back to the repository root (so imports like `python -m extreme_model...` resolve).
